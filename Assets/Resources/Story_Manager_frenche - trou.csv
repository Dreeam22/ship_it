0;0;1;0;Charlie a un <color="red">1</color> sur Sasha mais est trop stressée pour aller lui parler, elle attend qu'iel fasse le premier pas. Sasha est tellement <color="red">2</color>, iel ne vois pas ses propres sentiments et la façon dont Charlie le.a regarde*

1;0;1;1;Both of them started to be clingy with each other, always searching for contact. Sasha initiated it, by accident though. 
The group of friends were in a park, but there wasn't enough room on the bench so Sasha offered Charlie to sit on their lap. Despite being struck by a great dose of stress, she accepted and sat carefully, scared to hurt them.
She was surprised by Sasha hugging them from behind a few minutes after, but instead of panicking she leaned back, wanting the both of them to be comfortable. It was a new feeling for her, not being stressed with someone, it scared her a bit but for the time being she was embracing it.
Sasha didn’t overthink the move. They were a bit cold and felt like this would be a good idea. And it was. Charlie was warm and her leaning into the hug made it even better. 
Their friends didn’t react to the sudden affection between them. They stayed like this, half-listening to the other’s discussion till the group decided it was time to go home.*

2;0;1;2;When Sasha admitted to Charlie that they liked her a lot, Charlie almost passed out.
She wasn’t prepared for this. She couldn’t be in control of the situation so she started to panic, not knowing what and how to answer. At least they were alone, it made the scene a bit less uncomfortable.
Charlie wanted to leave but Sasha, who had their eyes locked on her since the beginning, said “You don’t have to answer or anything, I just wanted to tell you ‘cause I felt like it. I’m just warning you that I’ll keep on hugging you when I can”, with a little smirk on their face.
And with that, Charlie calmed down a bit, enough to remove the urge to leave. She didn’t answer and the both of them waited here, close to each other till the bell rang, warning the end of classes.
They hugged and headed home. Later in the evening, Sasha received a text from Charlie saying “I like you too, you make me comfortable, maybe we could hang out more if you’d like”. This sent a rush of heat in Sasha’s cheeks.
Two weeks later, after a couple of dates they were officially a couple. It wasn’t easy at first, but they managed to find their balance. Now, whenever Charlie is having an existential crisis about anything, Sasha is here to help her see the bright side of things. Whereas when Sasha is over optimistic about something, Charlie helps them see the problems that could be encountered and the consequences.
They keep each other down to earth.*

3;0;2;0;They’ve known each other since kindergarten and are still doing nonsense together whenever they can. 
They are really close and tactile. Alex always comes from behind and hoppes on Sasha’s back, and Sasha never misses to catch him.
They are best friends and never thought of going further in their relationship.*

4;0;2;1;One day, one of their classmates asked if they were together. 
Dumb as he is, Alex answered that : Yes, they were together since kindergarten, got lucky to be accepted in the same high school and that it was really fun to be able to study with his bestfriend.
“So you are not a couple ?” asked the guy again, seeing that he didn’t understand the question.
Alex’s brain crashed. He never thought about that before. “I don’t think so” he answered, with a face that showed his questioning.
A couple hours after, during the break, he went to ask Sasha about it. Their answer were as stupid as Alex’s : “ Yeah we’re a couple, we’re two people always together ! Ain’t that the definition of a couple ?” And it made Alex more lost than ever. Sasha also thought about it.
After a few days, both of them agreed that they were a couple, following the previous reasoning and went on with their highschool life.*

5;0;2;2;One or two weeks later, a girl explained to them what “a couple” meant, romantically and sexually. 
And they both sat there for 5 minutes, processing the information without saying a word. Until the bell rang the end of lunch break.
Alex just didn’t understand why anyone never told him about this kind of relationship. Cause of how dumb he his, he never noticed it in other couples. He always thought they were best friends.
He spent the rest of the day and the evening investigating about couples. The day after, he went to borrow some romantic books at the library. He liked the softness of the interactions that the characters had with each other.
Sasha knew about this kind of relationship, but it never came to their head that they could or should have that with Alex. Their relationship was already wholesome. But they started to think about it, maybe it could enhance what they had ?
After that, they started to be even closer, and it was really comfortable for both of them. They knew each other for so long but they had trouble communicating in their new relationship.
Eventually they sorted it out and they became the “Stupid couple”, always up to do something dumb !*

6;0;3;0;Taylor always has a book opened in front of him. Sasha usually scrolls their phone next to him and shows him the interesting things they find.
Taylor is studious but is always happy when Sasha shows him things they find interesting, it shows him what they like. He really likes to learn more about them.
Sasha also really likes to entertain Taylor and see that he is interested in what they show him.*

7;0;3;1;“Here you go ! I hope you like it” Sasha said with a big smile on their face. 
The day before, they offered to cook Taylor’s lunch, which made him really happy ! But he only managed to say “Oh, well if you’d wanna why not, I think I’d like it, yeah”.
On lunch break, they sat in a corner of the cafeteria and Sasha put two big bags on the table. They started to eat and Taylor felt blessed, it was sooo good ! He could never cook this well. He wanted to express how he felt, but it was hard for him. He simply said “It is really good, thanks for that”.
Sasha knew him. For him to say that meant a lot. “I’m glad you like it, I had fun yesterday making it”.
They finished eating while talking about how Sasha prepared all of it. They couldn’t finish everything so they split the leftovers to bring home.
Taylor started to think about a way to return the favor and Sasha was already searching new recipes for another occasion.*

8;0;3;2;After the lunch Sasha made them, Taylor had an idea on how to return the favor. He wasn’t as creative as them but had at least a few hobbies : books and movies. His idea was to invite Sasha home, so they could share the experience of watching a movie together and eat whatever Sasha would like.
He wanted to suggest the idea tomorrow during the morning break, but Sasha didn’t show up and he received a text from them “I won’t be able to come during this break, classmates are organizing a thing and I need to be there”. He then replied “Ok, no worries, we’ll see each other at lunch break”.
And they did, Taylor asked them what was the thing they talked about. Sasha didn’t really explain and changed the topic of the conversation. Taylor didn’t really want to pressure them, if they didn’t want to talk about it that wasn’t a problem.
Sadly he didn’t manage to ask Sasha about doing a movie night. He would try tomorrow.
But he didn’t get the chance to do it. During the whole week Sasha didn’t show up during breaks, and when they did, it wouldn’t last 5 min. Taylor wasn’t alone so it wasn’t a big problem, but still, he wondered why they didn’t want to talk about that to him and felt pretty sad not being able to spend time with them. <i>They’re free to do anything they want though</i> he told himself.
When he left the building to get the bus, he saw Sasha with another person, laughing… He kinda felt jealous and a rush of angst went through him. He didn’t want to be jealous, he just wanted to watch them have fun and respect that they found new friends or more. Still, he felt bad and started to be scared that Sasha will move away from him. He decided to send them a text asking if they could see each other and talk during lunch break. He wasn’t really confident but it was the best thing to do.
The day after, they were both on time, Taylor explained to them his worries to which Sasha answered “Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t know it would worry you. I didn’t want to bother you with the dramas happening with my classmates. I’m also sad that we didn’t get time for each other, I’m always looking forward to spending at least 5 min with you” while saying that both of them blushed a bit, enough for each to notice. “But I really needed to be there to help solve the problem. I should be more free now that it’s pretty much settled” 
“I get it” replied Taylor, “You are always here for others and that’s what I like about you. I just would have been reassured if you shared with me, I’m glad we made things clear. If you are free, what about  coming to my home tomorrow after school to watch a movie together ?” His happiness showed through his voice, which made Sasha smile.
“Of course I’d like to ! I’ll cook something that we’ll eat while watching !”*

9;2;3;0;Alex is an idiot. An idiot who likes a studious guy. And what he likes above everything is to annoy him and get him out of his comfort zone. That’s when Taylor is the most honest and that’s what Alex loves about him. 
Taylor is uncomfortable when Alex does everything to drive him mad. But seeing him laugh makes him a bit weak so he just rolls his eyes and lets him go away with all the bullshit he can make.*

10;2;3;1;Taylor is always here to make up for Alex’s bullshit. The last thing he did was getting in trouble with a group of guys who were twice his size. Taylor had to interpose himself so they didn't start to fight and get Alex out of this.
“Why the hell did you do this ?” Taylor almost yelled.
“They were criticizing girls from my class” he pouted
“And that’s a reason to get yourself in trouble or worse, get beaten ?!”
“I wouldn’t be beaten, I’m too fast for them” he said proudly “Plus if I can make them shut their mouth I’d do it everyday”
“Yeah I figured” Taylor said, pinching his nose. “Anyway I wouldn’t like to pick you up with a teaspoon, so care for yourself please”.
“Ugh” he replied, but actually he was happy, that’s the first time that Taylor admitted he cared for him.
The day after Alex got sick and had to rest at home. Taylor spent the day with their group of friends but the hours seemed to last twice longer. How come the day was that long ? He had a lot of things to do but nothing was really entertaining him and he finished all of his homework for the week. And it still wasn't the end of the day, there was 40 minutes left ! 
He then sat there, staring at the clock and eventually got lost in his thoughts. He imagined how Alex would have reacted to the things that happened today. He then realized : he missed Alex and his silliness, that’s why the day went so slowly.
After school Taylor went to Alex’s house, to give him the lessons and the homeworks of the day, at least that was the excuse. In reality he just wanted to spend time with him.*

11;2;3;2;It’s been a week since Taylor realized Alex’s fooleries were entertaining and that he liked them. 
He started doing cocky things too, and it was thrilling ! Alex noticed it and couldn’t be happier, he easily went along with it. Teachers couldn’t believe that the head of class, Taylor, was doing bullshit, so they always blamed Alex for everything but he didn’t care. He was the only one seeing Taylor having fun and that was new.
Taylor still kept his composure, he didn’t want his actions to have bad repercussions. Alex respected his limits and it made him less hot-headed too.
One day, they skipped class and went to sit in a calm place where they couldn’t be found, both had their backs against a tree. Their plan was to play a game on their phone together, but they ended up just talking.
It was Taylor who started.
“Thank you” he said
“Eh ? What for ?” asked Alex “Making you skip class and have shitty grades ?”
“Nah, for making me have fun with you. Skipping class is just a consequence”
“A consequence ? How is it a consequence ?” said Alex, visibly confused
“Well, it’s a consequence of me wanting to spend time with you more than anything” answered Taylor
“Oh I see. Well, I also love spending time with you, even more since you’re more yourself. I just hope I’m not forcing you into anything.
“Nah you’re not, don’t worry. But you’re right, I’m more myself these days and I feel more confident. And that’s thanks to you.”
“That’s thanks to you too, you did it, you chose to change. Honestly I just showed you what it was to be a delinquent.” he said, leaning closer to Taylor
“You must be right I guess. But you’re not a delinquent, you are just dumb !” turning to face him.
And then they laughed, a lot, so much that when they stopped they both felt a bit light headed.
“I think I like you” finally said Alex, “A lot I mean” his cheeks turning pinker than usual.
Taylor understood and replied shilly “I like you a lot too”, and he felt his cheek turning red.
“Well then, hug me” Alex said, and made his way into Taylor’s arms.*

12;1;2;0;Charlie really likes Alex and his cheerfulness but she will never tell her true feelings, in fear of being vulnerable. 
On the contrary, Alex says everything that crosses his mind and really wants to impress Charlie and make her laugh.*

13;1;2;1;It was the first hour of the day and Alex was already full of energy.
“Charlie ! You wouldn’t guess what I did yesterday !” he said to the girl.
“You’re right, I wouldn’t guess.” she didn’t bother to ask, knowing that he would totally tell her.
“I played Mario Kart with my sisters and I beat them at every single game !”
“Well, your sisters are like 10, I don’t really know if it’s really an accomplishment.”
“Maybe, but we had such fun ! I can’t wait to play with them again” he said with a big smile on his face. Charlie couldn’t keep from smiling herself. “Would you like to play with us ?” Alex asked.
“Nah, I’ve got to study this week.” she answered.
“You’re so studious it’s amazing, I wish I was as motivated as you to study but it annoys me so much and I usually don’t understand anything” he sighed.
<i>I wish I could express my feelings as much as you</i>, Charlie thought, but she replied something completely different. “Well, if you spend more time studying maybe you could understand more things”
“Yeah I thought about it, a lot really, but I just went to the solution that having fun was more important” he replied with a serious face, which is a really rare thing. Charlie doesn’t even think that she ever saw him with this expression.
It made her laugh cause it looked really weird on him, which surprised Alex but he went along with it and laughed too.*

14;1;2;2;As usual, Alex spent the day doing stupid things and being flirty with everyone. He’s always surrounded by a lot of people, Charlie on the contrary is a bit isolated but it pleases her, that’s her comfort zone, where she can be in control. Her peaceful moment didn’t last long. Alex screamed her name from the other side of the classroom, making everyone turn their head towards him, then to Charlie. Which made her really uncomfortable and a knot of stress started to form in her stomach.
He then came to her, with a paper in his left hand “Hey look ! I managed to get a good grade !”
Seeing that a drama wasn’t going to happen, everyone went back to their conversations. Charlie was still coping with the rush of embarrassment so she just glanced at him and went back to her exercise.
“Are you alright ?” he asked
“Yeah, I’m glad you got a good grade” she replied, still looking at her books.
“Are you alright ?” he said again, with a deeper tone
“Yeah, I already answered” and then the ring noticed the start of the next course. Saved by the bell, literally thought Charlie.
“Why don’t you ever want to say your true feelings ? “ said Alex, low enough so only Charlie heard it.
She then stood her head towards him and saw his face, conflicted between anger and sadness. He had watery eyes and his cheeks were turning red. She never saw him like that.
He clenched his fist and turned around, going to his classroom.
He didn’t listen to a word of the math class, it wasn’t unordinary so no one was really worried.
He calmed himself and got his mind straight. Then he sent a text to Charlie “Let’s meet after school at the bus stop, I’d like to talk with you” the bus stop was an isolated spot that Alex showed to Charlie a few weeks ago, they would be just the two of them there.
Charlie showed up.
She thought of no going, her instinct telling her that since she didn’t initiate the situation, the worse could happen and that she wouldn't be in control. But seeing Alex like that really moved her and a part of her trusted him. She didn’t trust a lot of people.
“I really like you and I would like to understand more of what you think.” he said, looking her in the eye. “You are my favorite person in the world, and when we spend time together without our walls up that’s when I’m… the happiest” red starting to invade his cheeks
“Say something please…” he said shily. It made Charlie get out of her thoughts and she looked away, which made Alex whine of sadness. She then immediately locked her eyes on him and said “I didn’t think you thought of me this way… You have so many friends I just thought I was one in the mass. But now that you talk about it, it’s true that when we’re together I really feel… myself”
Alex sighed in relief and smiled with a face only he could do.
“You’re so eager to protect yourself from external things that you didn’t even see the obvious”
Charlie then blushed “Well if you said it directly maybe I would have understood !”
“If that’s what you want. Would you like to go out with me ?” he asked “Nothing would be ambiguous with that“
“I’ll say yes, but it’s only for me to help you with your communication skills and for you to help me handle my stress” she said, her chicks completely red
Alex then hugs her tight and says “Yeah, only for that” and Charlie returns the hug.*

15;1;3;0;They are rivals, they have the same grades and compete for the 1st place in their class. 
They are always throwing shades at each other but in the end, they are here for each other and they study together.*

16;1;3;1;One day, someone talks shit about Taylor and Charlie steps up for him. Taylor usually doesn’t care about what people say about him so he doesn’t understand why she does that. 
He then asks her why she did that. He knows that she doesn’t like confrontation and due to her stress she quickly panics in situations where she doesn’t have control.
Charlie explains that she just doesn’t stand that people can talk shit about him. He’s grumpy and not friendly like all of them but he’s genuinely nice and attentive to others. And he’s smarter than all of them together.
Taylor blushes at the amount of compliments and says “Well, thanks, it’s just that you don’t do that for anyone else so I was surprised”
Seeing Taylor being a bit embarrassed like that makes Charlie’s heart skip a beat and Oh she realises something and starts to panic so she quickly answers “Well, you are my rival so I wouldn’t like that people say bad things about you, my win wouldn’t be as glorious then” and runs to her next class, earlier than usual.*

17;1;3;2;The finals are coming so they both are studying a lot, sometimes together, sometimes not. Lately they have been a bit distant, especially Charlie since the fuss with their classmates happened. Taylor wants to focus on the finals so he doesn’t bring it up.
After the last exam of the finals, Charlie quickly gets out of the classroom, instead of waiting for Taylor and going together to the library as they usually do after exams, to check if they got anything wrong and reassure themselves.
He doesn’t run after her, he prefers to text her and ask what’s wrong.
She replies later “I kinda feel stressed around you, but it’s not something you did or didn’t ! I’m just lost… I don’t really know how to explain it.” It took her whole courage to write and send this text. She’s stressed and waits, a part of her conscience locked on the phone.
"ding A text from Taylor. She goes to open it, then she doesn’t want to, afraid of the answer. Eventually she opens it and feels relieved. The text says ""I think I kinda get what you're trying to say, do you want to talk about it ? I'm not used to listening to people but for you I'd like to try."

"After that they talked all night, they both opened themselves little by little. Around 6 A.M, half asleep and reassured by the discussion, Charlie asked ""Would you like it if we dated? I'd like to know more about you and I feel like we could be a good couple idk"
"Taylor, a bit surprised, blushed and replied ""Yeah, I'd like to, you are the first really interesting person I've ever met and I think we would be such a powerful couple"
Then they both fell asleep and woke up late in the morning, thankfully it was the weekend. Charlie had to re read at least 5 times their last text to realize what happened. She was stressed but happy.
They kept on texting the whole weekend and they would see each other on Monday and have their first date after school.*
